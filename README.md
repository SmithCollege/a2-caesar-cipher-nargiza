## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?

I really enjoyed creating the Caesar cipher. It was satisfying to see how shifting letters within an array could transform a message. I liked figuring out how to move the elements and handling cases when the shift wrapped around the end of the arrayâ€”it felt like solving a neat little puzzle.

What was most challenging about this assignment?

Debugging was definitely the toughest part. I spent a lot of time making sure all the tests passed, and it was sometimes frustrating to track down the little mistakes that were causing the tests to fail. However, each bug fixed made the code feel more solid and taught me a bit more about careful testing.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:

Working with GitHub Classroom for the first time was a cool experience. It pushed me to adopt new tools and step into the tester role, which gave me a fresh perspective on the importance of thorough testing.
